**Capstone Project â€“ Summer Analytics 2025**  
Hosted by: Consulting & Analytics Club Ã— Pathway

## ðŸš¦ Problem Statement

Urban parking lots often suffer from inefficient pricingâ€”either being underutilized or overcrowded. This project introduces a **dynamic pricing engine** for 14 parking spaces, adjusting prices in real-time based on:
- Occupancy
- Queue length
- Traffic congestion
- Vehicle type
- Special events
- Competitor pricing

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build a real-time simulation system using:
- ðŸ“ˆ Data-driven pricing models (built from scratch)
- ðŸ”„ Real-time streaming with [Pathway](https://pathway.com)
- ðŸ“Š Visualization using Bokeh

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

### Model 1: Linear Pricing
A basic formula based on occupancy ratio:
